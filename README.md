# Tiny Face Detector in TensorFlow

 A TensorFlow port(inference only) of Tiny Face Detector from [authors' MatConvNet codes](https://github.com/peiyunh/tiny)[1].

# Requirements

Codes are written in Python. At first install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install.html).
Then install [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

# Usage

## Converting a pretrained model

`matconvnet_hr101_to_pickle` reads weights of the MatConvNet pretrained model and 
write back to a pickle file which is used in a TensorFlow model as initial weights.

1. Download a [ResNet101-based pretrained model(hr_res101.mat)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Epeiyunh/tiny/hr_res101.mat) 
from the authors' repo.

2. Convert the model to a pickle file by:

#before running the below command make a blank mat2tf.pkl file
```
python matconvnet_hr101_to_pickle.py 
        --matlab_model_path /path/to/pretrained_model 
        --weight_file_path  /path/to/pickle_file
```

## Tesing Tiny Face Detector in TensorFlow

1. Prepare images in a directory. 

2. `tiny_face_eval.py` reads images one by one from the image directory and 
write images to an output directory with bounding boxes of detected faces.
```
python tiny_face_eval.py
  --weight_file_path /path/to/pickle_file
  --data_dir /path/to/input_image_directory
  --output_dir /path/to/output_directory
```
## Tesing Tiny Face Detector in TensorFlow with webcam

Run:

python tiny_face_eval_webcam.py



# Neural network diagram

[This](https://github.com/cydonia999/Tiny_Faces_in_Tensorflow/blob/master/networks/ResNet101.pdf)(pdf) is 
a network diagram of the ResNet101-based model used here for an input image(height: 1150, width: 2048, channel: 3).


# Examples

Though this model is developed to detect tiny faces, I apply this to several types of images including 'faces' 
as experiments.
